### Abstract
This paper inspects the impact of feature vector produced by Frechet Distance (FD) along with the conventional distance based features to recognize online handwritten Bangla characters. FD based feature computation starts with dividing a character sample into different rectangular zones. Then FD values are computed from each zone to every other zones. In distance based feature extraction technique also a character sample is divided into several segments and distances are measured from a particular segment to all other segments. Feature vectors so produced are experimented on 10000 online handwritten Bangla characters. SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier produces the reasonably satisfactory recognition accuracy of 98.98% when FD based features are combined with distance based features.
