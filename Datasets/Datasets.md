## Dataset preparation and pre-processing
Variation among the data present in a database is a basic need to assess the strength of any algorithm in the domain of handwriting 
recognition. Keeping this issue in mind, 100 persons belonging to different age group with varied educational and social background, 
sex etc. are made involved during the data collection process. As, there are 50 distinct symbols in the Bangla alphabet, hence a database 
constituting 10000 character symbols has been prepared under this work. No strict burden were forced on the contributors. In  this 
experiment, each character is normalized into 64 points and scaled in a window of size 512x512.
